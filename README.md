## Introduction
Convolutional networks (ConvNets) have recently enjoyed a great success in large-scale image and video recognition.

Utilise smaller receptive window size and smaller stride of the first convolutional layer.
Another line of improvements dealt with training and testing the networks densely over the whole image and over multiple scales
